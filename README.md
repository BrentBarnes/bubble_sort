# bubble_sort

Assignment:
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology

This became relatively simple once I resolved to using the #times method. I know that #times might force the program to iterate more times than necessary because iterating (n-1) times, where n is the length of the array, is the maximum possible amount of times it will take to sort the array.

Knowing this, I tried to use a counter that counted how many times the program had to swap the numbers on each iteration. However, upon trying for an extended amount of time, I don't know if this functionality exists? An each loop will only iterate through the array once. I could not find a way to iterate multiple times. Maybe there is, and I am unaware. This will have to wait for the second version!
